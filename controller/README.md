# Electron-Scaffold
My simple and rather straight forward electron scaffold for the starting projects.

To Use:

1. Install NPM/Node (kinda the big one)

2. npm install (to install deps/modules)

3. npm start (to start it up)

To Build:

1. Make sure you have any dependencies installed that you need if you modify this.
2. [Install Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)
3. In your CLI:
  - 'electron-packager . --platform=darwin --out=./release' - For macOS
  - 'electron-packager . --platform=win32 --out=./release' - For Win
